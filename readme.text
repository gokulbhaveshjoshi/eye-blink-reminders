Developers or any person who spends long hours in front of a screen may face eye problems due to continuous screen exposure. To mitigate this, we want to build a Chrome extension that reminds users to take eye breaks by blinking the screen at regular intervals.


Let me know if youâ€™d like to integrate:

User settings (sound on/off, theme) with this

Toast/alert/modal logic as separate types

Eye exercise messages instead of black screen

I can help you modularize it next.
